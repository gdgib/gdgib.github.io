# About Me
<br/>
{% capture about %}
<p>I'm a hardware & software architect.
When I say full stack I'm not kidding: everything from transistors to copyright law.
My job is curing cancer, coding is just a hobby.</p>

<p>Since 2013, I've worked as software architect and manager at first <a href="http://www.bina.com">Bina Technologies</a> later acquired by <a href="http://sequencing.roche.com/en.html">Roche Sequencing</a>.
Design, coding, testing, infrastructure, management, leadership, recruiting, copyright, etc.
There's no end to what I've done, and no start to my talents.</p>

<p>For my artistic coding, see below, where you'll find a mix of the creative, practical and eye-ball-wateringly-complex.
Despite their diversity, the rest of my hobbies have one thing in common: they don't involve computers.
If you want to know more, we'll just have to meet off the internet.</p>
