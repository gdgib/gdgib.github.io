Design as a standard library for FPGA development, GateLib contained standardized Verilog gateware as well as automated build tools and software to interface with FPGAs.
GateLib contained was used to build [RePar](RePar.html) and [ParaLearn](ParaLearn.html).
It was also used by several other projects including RAMP at U.C. Berkeley, and Liquid from I.B.M. research.
