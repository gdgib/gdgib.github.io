Developed a line-rate gigabit ethernet packet capture driver for Intel NICs on Windows.
Required extensive C/C++ programming, Windows kernel development and performance optimization.
At the time of the this project only server-class machines with high performance PCI (not PCIe) busses could support such operations, and memory mapped user/kernel circular buffers were required.
