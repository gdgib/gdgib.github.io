As a senior software engineer at a small, but high impact, startup I was responsible for everything from framework development to training engineers on IDEs.
I built test automation frameworks, web applications and bioinformatics pipelines sometimes all at the same time.
In addition to the more internal achievements I was a part of the [team that placed 1st & 2nd in the DREAM challenge](https://sequencing.roche.com/ja-jp/news-overview/2015/bina-places-1st-and-2nd-in-dream-challenge.html), as well as building, from scratch, our RNA support.
