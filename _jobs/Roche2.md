# Projects

My role includes management of the internal software architecture team, with a personal focus on architecture strategy across product lines.
At times I have taken on larger management roles pro-tem as the organization has grown.
The majority of my personal technical work is in underlying frameworks, internal technologies and the RSS Open Source strategy.

Projects I've contributed to:

* [AVENIO NGS Oncology Assays](https://sequencing.roche.com/en/products-solutions/by-category/assays.html)
* [NAVIFY Mutation Profiler](https://www.navify.com/mutation-profiler/)
* [NimbleDesign](https://sequencing.roche.com/en/products-solutions/by-category/target-enrichment/software/nimble-design-software.html)
* Significant internal and future products
