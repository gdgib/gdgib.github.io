# Projects

During the Roche acquisition of Bina my role shifted several times, including helping to form the new Roche Sequencing culture, hiring and forming the software architecture team and project management.
While software architecture remained my primary job, I played a huge role in growing the organization and ensuring we remained stable and productive.

Projects I've worked on include:

* [AVENIO NGS Oncology Assays](https://sequencing.roche.com/en/products-solutions/by-category/assays.html)
* Significant internal and future products
